I build performance-critical systems, with an interest in database internals, distributed computing, ML infrastructure, and high-concurrency engineering. Currently contributing to [Sail](https://github.com/lakehq/sail), a Spark-compatible compute engine in Rust. I also research LLM reliability, from investigating post-output evaluation methods to probing internal layer signals for early hallucination detection.
