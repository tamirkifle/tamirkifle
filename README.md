### About Me

MS Computer Science candidate at Northeastern University (GPA: 4.0, graduating Dec 2026) specializing in **distributed systems, database internals, and systems engineering**. Currently serving as a Teaching Assistant for Scalable Distributed Systems.

I build performance-critical infrastructure, with a focus on writing low-level, high-concurrency software that handles massive scale.

### Current Focus

* **Internship:** Starting Jan 30 @ **Lakesail**, building [Sail](https://github.com/lakehq/sail) (a high-performance Spark-compatible engine in Rust).

### Technical Stack

**Languages & Frameworks:** Python · Java · C++ · Rust · SQL · TypeScript · Spring Boot · PyTorch · OpenCV

**Infrastructure & Tools:** AWS (EC2, ECS, DynamoDB) · PostgreSQL · Docker · Kubernetes · Redis · Kafka · RabbitMQ · gRPC · Terraform

**Specializations:** Distributed Systems · Systems Programming · Cloud Infrastructure · Database Internals · Performance Engineering


### Experience Highlights

* **Incoming Software Engineer Intern** @ Lakesail (Jan 30) — Contributing to the development of [Sail](https://github.com/lakehq/sail), a unified distributed compute engine.
* **Research Assistant** @ Northeastern University — Built high-throughput data curation pipelines processing 10M+ records for LLM evaluation.
* **Teaching Assistant:** CS6650 - Scalable Distributed Systems.
* **Software Engineer Intern** @ Canaria — Engineered RAG services and optimized daily-refresh pipelines for 700M+ records.
* **Full Stack Engineer** @ Scandiweb — Shipped performance optimizations for high-revenue e-commerce platforms; optimized MySQL/ERP data synchronization.

### Featured Projects

* **Minimal LLM Inference Engine:** From-scratch Rust implementation featuring GGUF parsing and memory-mapped I/O for performance.
* **Distributed KV Database:** Java-based store with quorum replication, vector clocks, and Jepsen-style consistency testing.
* **Distributed Ski Tracker:** Event-driven infrastructure sustaining 8K req/sec using RabbitMQ and DynamoDB.
* **Real-Time Object Recognition:** C++ pipeline with PCA compression and separable Gaussian filters for efficiency.
