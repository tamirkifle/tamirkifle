### About Me

MS Computer Science candidate at Northeastern University (GPA: 4.0, graduating Dec 2026) specializing in distributed systems and AI infrastructure. Currently serving as a Teaching Assistant for Scalable Distributed Systems and a Research Assistant focused on LLM evaluation and data curation pipelines.

I build performance-oriented systems that handle scale, with experience spanning low-level software development, machine learning infrastructure, and cloud architectures.

### Current Focus

* **Research:** Data curation and hallucination evaluation frameworks for LLMs.
* **Development:** Building high-performance LLM inference engines and distributed stores.
* **Teaching:** CS6650 - Scalable Distributed Systems.

### Technical Stack

**Languages & Frameworks** Python · Java · C++ · Rust · SQL · TypeScript · Spring Boot · PyTorch · OpenCV

**Infrastructure & Tools** AWS (EC2, ECS, DynamoDB) · PostgreSQL · Docker · Kubernetes · Redis · Kafka · RabbitMQ · gRPC · Terraform

**Specializations** Distributed Systems · Performance Engineering · LLM Inference · System Design · Cloud Infrastructure

### Experience Highlights

* **Software Engineer Intern** @ Canaria - Engineered RAG text-to-SQL services and daily-refresh pipelines for 700M+ records.
* **Research Assistant** @ Northeastern University - Built data curation pipelines processing 10M+ records for LLM evaluation.
* **Full Stack Engineer** @ Scandiweb - Shipped features for e-commerce platforms with $50M+ revenue; optimized MySQL/ERP data sync.

### Featured Projects

Check out my pinned repositories below for work on:

* **Minimal LLM Inference Engine:** From-scratch Rust implementation with GGUF parsing and memory-mapped I/O.
* **Distributed KV Database:** Java-based store with quorum replication, vector clocks, and Jepsen-style testing.
* **Real-Time Object Recognition:** C++ pipeline with PCA compression and separable Gaussian filters for efficiency.
* **Distributed Ski Tracker:** Event-driven system sustaining 8K req/sec using RabbitMQ and DynamoDB.
